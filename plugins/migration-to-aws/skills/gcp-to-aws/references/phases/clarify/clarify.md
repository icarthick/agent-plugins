# Phase 2: Clarify Requirements

**Phase 2 of 5** — Ask adaptive questions before design begins, then interpret answers into ready-to-apply design constraints.

The output — `preferences.json` — is consumed directly by Design and Estimate without any further interpretation.

Questions are organized into **six named categories (A–F)** with documented firing rules. Up to 22 questions across categories, depending on which discovery artifacts exist and which GCP services are detected. A standalone **AI-Only** flow exists for migrations that only move AI/LLM calls to Bedrock.

## Category Reference Files

| File                  | Category                     | Questions | Loaded When                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `clarify-global.md`   | A — Global/Strategic         | Q1–Q7     | Always                                          |
| `clarify-compute.md`  | B — Config Gaps, C — Compute | Q8–Q11    | Compute or billing-source resources present     |
| `clarify-database.md` | D — Database                 | Q12–Q13   | Database resources present                      |
| `clarify-ai.md`       | F — AI/Bedrock               | Q14–Q22   | `ai-workload-profile.json` exists               |
| `clarify-ai-only.md`  | _(standalone)_               | Q1–Q10    | AI-only migration (no infrastructure artifacts) |

## Step 0: Prior Run Check

If `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json` already exists:

> "I found existing migration preferences from a previous run. Would you like to:"
>
> A) Re-use these preferences and skip questions
> B) Start fresh and re-answer all questions

- If A: skip to Validation Checklist, proceed with existing file.
- If B: continue to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Read Inventory and Determine Migration Type

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/` and check which discovery outputs exist:

- `gcp-resource-inventory.json` + `gcp-resource-clusters.json` — infrastructure discovered
- `ai-workload-profile.json` — AI workloads detected
- `billing-profile.json` — billing data parsed

At least one discovery artifact must exist to proceed.

### Migration Type Detection

- **Full migration**: `gcp-resource-inventory.json` or `billing-profile.json` exists (may also have `ai-workload-profile.json`)
- **AI-only migration**: ONLY `ai-workload-profile.json` exists (no infrastructure or billing artifacts)

**If AI-only**: Load `clarify-ai-only.md` and follow that flow. Skip all remaining steps below.

### Discovery Summary

Present a discovery summary:

**If `gcp-resource-inventory.json` exists:**

> **Infrastructure discovered:** [total resources] GCP resources across [cluster count] clusters
> **Top resource types:** [list top 3–5 types]

**If `ai-workload-profile.json` exists:**

> **AI workloads detected:** [from `models[].model_id`]
> **Capabilities in use:** [from `integration.capabilities_summary` where true]
> **Integration pattern:** [from `integration.pattern`] via [from `integration.primary_sdk`]

**If `billing-profile.json` exists:**

> **Monthly GCP spend:** $[total_monthly_spend]
> **Top services by cost:** [top 3–5 from billing data]

---

## Step 2: Extract Known Information

Before generating questions, scan the inventory to extract values that are already known:

1. **GCP regions** — Extract all GCP regions from the inventory. Map to the closest AWS region as a suggested default for Q1.
2. **Resource types present** — Build a set of resource types: compute (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, GKE, GCE), database (Cloud SQL, Spanner, Memorystore), storage (Cloud Storage), messaging (Pub/Sub).
3. **Billing SKUs** — If `billing-profile.json` exists, check if any SKU reveals storage class, HA configuration, or other answerable questions.
4. **Config confidence** — If inventory `metadata.source = "billing"`, identify resources with `config_confidence = "assumed"` for Category B questions.
5. **AI framework detection** — If `ai-workload-profile.json` exists, check `integration.gateway_type` and `integration.frameworks` for auto-detection of Q14 answer.

Record extracted values. Questions whose answers are fully determined by extraction will be skipped and the extracted value used directly with `chosen_by: "extracted"`.

## Step 3: Generate Questions by Category

### Category Definitions and Firing Rules

| Category | Name               | Firing Rule                                                                                     | Reference File        | Questions                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**    | Global/Strategic   | **Always fires**                                                                                | `clarify-global.md`   | Q1 (location), Q2 (compliance), Q3 (GCP spend), Q4 (funding stage), Q5 (multi-cloud), Q6 (uptime), Q7 (maintenance) |
| **B**    | Configuration Gaps | Inventory with `metadata.source == "billing"` AND at least one `config_confidence == "assumed"` | `clarify-compute.md`  | Cloud SQL HA, Cloud Run count, Memorystore memory, Functions gen                                                    |
| **C**    | Compute Model      | Compute resources present (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, GKE, GCE)                                | `clarify-compute.md`  | Q8 (K8s sentiment), Q9 (WebSocket), Q10 (Cloud Run traffic), Q11 (Cloud Run spend)                                  |
| **D**    | Database Model     | Database resources present (Cloud SQL, Spanner, Memorystore)                                    | `clarify-database.md` | Q12 (DB traffic pattern), Q13 (DB I/O)                                                                              |
| **E**    | Migration Posture  | **Disabled by default** — requires explicit user opt-in                                         | _(inline below)_      | HA upgrades, right-sizing                                                                                           |
| **F**    | AI/Bedrock         | `ai-workload-profile.json` exists                                                               | `clarify-ai.md`       | Q14–Q22                                                                                                             |

**Apply firing rules:**

1. Always include Category A (load `clarify-global.md`).
2. Check inventory `metadata.source` — if `"billing"` with assumed configs, include Category B (load `clarify-compute.md`).
3. Check for compute resources — if present, include Category C (load `clarify-compute.md`). Within C, skip Q8 if no GKE present. Skip Q10/Q11 if no Cloud Run present.
4. Check for database resources — if present, include Category D (load `clarify-database.md`). Skip Q12/Q13 if no Cloud SQL present.
5. Category E is disabled by default. Do not present unless user opts in.
6. Check for `ai-workload-profile.json` — if present, include Category F (load `clarify-ai.md`).

**If no IaC, billing data, or code is available** (empty discovery): fire only Category A. All service-specific categories are skipped.

### Early-Exit Rules

Apply these before presenting questions:

- **Q5 = "Yes, multi-cloud required"** — Immediately record `compute: "eks"`. Skip Q8 (Kubernetes sentiment) — all container workloads resolve to EKS.
- **Q10/Q11 N/A** — Cloud Run not present, auto-skip.
- **Q12/Q13 N/A** — Cloud SQL not present, auto-skip.
- **Q14 auto-detected** — If `integration.gateway_type` and `integration.frameworks` fully resolve the framework, skip Q14 and use extracted value.

---

## Category E — Migration Posture (Disabled by Default)

_Fire when:_ User explicitly opts in.
_Default behavior when disabled:_ Apply conservative defaults — no HA upgrades, no right-sizing.

If the user opts in, present after all other categories:

- **HA upgrade preference**: Should we recommend upgrading Single-AZ to Multi-AZ where possible?
  > Default: No — keep current topology.
- **Right-sizing from billing**: Should we use billing utilization data to right-size instance types?
  > Default: No — match current capacity.

---

## Step 4: Present Questions

Show all generated questions at once, grouped by section. Use a conversational tone with brief context explaining why each question matters. Show a progress indicator: **"Question N of M"** where M is the total number of questions being asked (after filtering).

```
Before mapping your infrastructure to AWS, I have some questions to tailor the migration plan.
You can answer each, skip individual ones (I'll use sensible defaults),
or say "use all defaults" to proceed with all recommendations.

--- Section 1: About Your Users & Requirements ---

Question 1 of [M]: [Q1 text with context]
Question 2 of [M]: [Q2 text with context]
...

--- Section 2: Your Infrastructure ---
[Only if Categories C/D fire]

Question [N] of [M]: [Q8 text with context]
...

--- Section 3: AI Workloads ---
[Only if Category F fires]

Question [N] of [M]: [Q14 text with context]
...
```

Wait for the user's response. Do NOT proceed to Design without a response or an explicit "use all defaults".

## Step 5: Interpret and Write preferences.json

Apply the interpret rule for every answered question (defined in each category file). For skipped questions, apply the documented default. Write `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json`:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
    "discovery_artifacts": ["gcp-resource-inventory.json", "ai-workload-profile.json"],
    "questions_asked": [
      "Q1",
      "Q2",
      "Q3",
      "Q5",
      "Q6",
      "Q7",
      "Q14",
      "Q16",
      "Q17",
      "Q19",
      "Q21",
      "Q22"
    ],
    "questions_defaulted": ["Q9"],
    "questions_skipped_extracted": ["Q14"],
    "questions_skipped_early_exit": ["Q8"],
    "questions_skipped_not_applicable": ["Q4", "Q10", "Q11", "Q12", "Q13"],
    "category_e_enabled": false,
    "inventory_clarifications": {}
  },
  "design_constraints": {
    "target_region": { "value": "us-east-1", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "compliance": { "value": ["hipaa"], "chosen_by": "user" },
    "gcp_monthly_spend": { "value": "$5K-$20K", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "funding_stage": { "value": "series-a", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "availability": { "value": "multi-az", "chosen_by": "default" },
    "cutover_strategy": { "value": "maintenance-window-weekly", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "kubernetes": { "value": "eks-or-ecs", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "database_traffic": { "value": "steady", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "db_io_workload": { "value": "medium", "chosen_by": "user" }
  },
  "ai_constraints": {
    "ai_framework": { "value": ["direct"], "chosen_by": "extracted" },
    "ai_monthly_spend": { "value": "$500-$2K", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "ai_priority": { "value": "balanced", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "ai_critical_feature": { "value": "function-calling", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "ai_volume_cost": { "value": "low-quality", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "ai_model_baseline": { "value": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "chosen_by": "derived" },
    "ai_vision": { "value": "text-only", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "ai_latency": { "value": "important", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "ai_complexity": { "value": "moderate", "chosen_by": "user" },
    "ai_capabilities_required": {
      "value": ["text_generation", "streaming", "function_calling"],
      "chosen_by": "derived"
    }
  }
}
```

### Schema Rules

1. Every entry in `design_constraints` and `ai_constraints` is an object with `value` and `chosen_by` fields.
2. `chosen_by` values: `"user"` (explicitly answered), `"default"` (system default applied — includes "I don't know" answers), `"extracted"` (inferred from inventory), `"derived"` (computed from combination of answers + detected capabilities).
3. Only write a key to `design_constraints` / `ai_constraints` if the answer produces a constraint. Absent keys mean "no constraint — Design decides."
4. Do not write null values.
5. For billing-source inventories, `metadata.inventory_clarifications` records Category B answers.
6. `metadata.questions_skipped_early_exit` records questions skipped due to early-exit logic (e.g., Q8 skipped because Q5=multi-cloud).
7. `metadata.questions_skipped_extracted` records questions skipped because inventory already provided the answer.
8. `metadata.questions_skipped_not_applicable` records questions skipped because the relevant service wasn't in the inventory.
9. `ai_constraints` section is present ONLY if Category F fired. Omit entirely if no AI artifacts exist.
10. `ai_constraints.ai_capabilities_required` is the UNION of detected capabilities from `ai-workload-profile.json` + critical feature from Q17 + vision from Q20. `chosen_by` is `"derived"`.
11. `ai_constraints.ai_framework` is an array (Q14 is select-all-that-apply). If auto-detected, `chosen_by` is `"extracted"`.

## Validation Checklist

Before handing off to Design:

- [ ] `preferences.json` written to `$MIGRATION_DIR/`
- [ ] `design_constraints.target_region` is populated with `value` and `chosen_by`
- [ ] `design_constraints.availability` is populated (if Q6 was asked or defaulted)
- [ ] Only keys with non-null values are present in `design_constraints`
- [ ] Every entry in `design_constraints` and `ai_constraints` has `value` and `chosen_by` fields
- [ ] Config gap answers recorded in `metadata.inventory_clarifications` (billing mode only)
- [ ] Early-exit skips recorded in `metadata.questions_skipped_early_exit`
- [ ] `ai_constraints` section present ONLY if Category F fired
- [ ] If Category F fired, `ai_constraints.ai_framework` is populated (from detection or Q14)
- [ ] If Category F fired, `ai_capabilities_required` is derived from detection + Q17 + Q20
- [ ] `ai_constraints.ai_framework` is an array (Q14 is multi-select)
- [ ] Output is valid JSON

## Step 6: Update Phase Status

Update `$MIGRATION_DIR/.phase-status.json`:

- Set `phases.clarify.status` to `"completed"`
- Set `phases.clarify.timestamp` to current ISO 8601 timestamp
- Set `phases.clarify.outputs` to `["preferences.json"]`
- Update `last_updated` to current timestamp

Output to user: "Clarification complete. Proceeding to Phase 3: Design AWS Architecture."

## Scope Boundary

**This phase covers requirements gathering ONLY.**

FORBIDDEN — Do NOT include ANY of:

- Detailed AWS architecture or service configurations
- Code migration examples or SDK snippets
- Detailed cost calculations
- Migration timelines or execution plans
- Terraform generation

**Your ONLY job: Understand what the user needs. Nothing else.**
